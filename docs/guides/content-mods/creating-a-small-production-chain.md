# Creating a small production chain

!!! info
    This guide is authored by Voxel Tycoon community member **scailman**.

	## Introduction

	In this guide you will learn how to create a new industry and all the elements that make it up. It's not a complex task but it's necessary to take into account many elements that are related to each other.
	
	Since we've explained how to create vehicles and trains in other guides, the process for their creation will not be repeated in this guide.
	
	A production chain can be very simple, using products and buildings that already exist in the base game, or have a very high degree of complexity, it all depends on our imagination.
	
	The best thing before starting to create items, buildings and vehicles, is to have an idea of what we want to do and create a small diagram of all the elements that our production chain needs. This is highly recommended since on many occasions we will have to link buildings with items or vehicles and problems may come up when we forget to correctly configure something in an asset.
	
	A production chain is made up of several steps, ore deposits, mining buildings, product processing building, warehouses and stores. All the buildings interact with each other and each one has a different extraction and production time, so adjustments must be made to have a balanced production in the different phases.

## Raw material deposits (`.depositrecipe` asset)

	Deposits of raw materials are the beginning of the production chain and are scattered throughout the regions. They are the main source of resources. As a finite amount of resources, they will become depleted when fully mined and will no longer be possible to extract.

```json
{
  "ItemUri": "scm_oil_industry/crude.item",
  "TintColor": "353535",
  "RadiusMultiplier": 0.5,
  "CapacityMultiplier": null,
  "DecorationUris": [],
  "Tier": 0
}
```

* **ItemUri:** Path of the item asset that will be extracted from the deposit.
* **TintColor:** This is the hexadecimal value of the color that the element represents on the map and when we press the Alt key to show icons on the map.
* **RadiusMultiplier:** Deposit size. By default the value is null. Values above 1 increase size and below decrease it.
* **CapacityMultiplier:** Amount of resources that can be extracted from the deposit. The default value is null.
* **DecorationUris ( Section ):** Deposits can have decorations like trees in forests. It's a list of all the paths of the asset files that will be shown as decoration on the deposit.

```json
"DecorationUris": [
    "base/spruce.plant"
  ],
```

* **Tier:** Deposit level Deposits at tier o are included in the first available region  when a new map is created. Higher tiers are available at a further distance. E.g. Coal, Iron Ore and Wood are tier 0, but
Copper, Sand and Stone are tier 1.

##Extracting resources (`.mine` asset )

Mines or any other type of building that allows the extraction of raw resources are special buildings that must be placed  whithin the area of the deposit.
They can only be placed in the resource that it can extract, for example you can't place an iron mine in a coal deposit.
Mines can have animated submeshes like steam locomotives and sound and smoke for when they're active.

## Manufacturing products (`.devices´asset)

Devices are the intermediate industries between raw material deposits and stores. These buildings require materials to produce the products that will be supplied to the stores.
Unlike the other buildings, these have input and output conveyor to supply raw materials or other required items.
The entrances and exits can be placed on any of the four facades of the building and don't have an established directionality, that is, if the building requires one item to produce another and has one entrance and one exit, it doesn't matter the direction of the conveyor.

The coordinates (0,0) are always in the upper right corner of the building and the positive values go from right to left and from top to bottom.
Values will be negative if they are above or to the right of the coordinates (0,0).
The code shown above represent an industry that have two conveyor (orange area in the diagram) that start at positions (0,4) and (0,5) respectively and have a rotation  of  90 degrees.
The rotation of the conveyors goes counterclockwise and starts at 0 degrees at the bottom of the building.

## Devices recipes (`.recipe`asset)

In order to produce items an industry must have a recipe that tells what item it requires, how much quantity it needs, and what product is manufactured from that quantity of items.

```json
{
  "TargetUri": "scm_oil_industry/refinery.recipetarget",
  "Duration": 18.0,
  "InputItems": [
    {
      "Uri": "scm_oil_industry/crude.item",
      "Count": 10.0
    }
  ],
  "OutputItems": [
    {
      "Uri": "scm_oil_industry/diesel.item",
      "Count": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "ResearchUri": "base/iron_smelting.research"
}
```

## Products (`.item` asset)

Items are the products that buildings require or generate.

![](/images/production-mod-tutorial/image5.png)

```json
{
  "IsLiquid": false,
  "Color": "353535",
  "MeshUri": "scm_oil_industry/crude_barrel.obj",
  "ConveyorLength": 0.3,
  "Weight": 0.5
}
```

* **Color:** Hexadecimal value of the color that represents the item in the pop-ups.
* **MeshUri:** .obj file used to represent the item.
* **ConveyorLength:** This value represents the size of the item on the conveyor. If the value is too high, the items will either overlap each other or run off the sides of the conveyor.
* **Weight:** Weight of one unit item.

## Storing resources and products (`.warehouse` asset ):

Warehouses allow items be stored so that certain buildings and vehicles can use them. Stores cannot be supplied directly from a warehouse.
They require a capacities, .heapcapacities, or stackcapacities asset in order to accept load.

![](/images/production-mod-tutorial/image6.png)

* **Liveries (Section):** Specifies the path of the building's .obj file. For more information about this section read the guide: Creating your first building mod.
* **Price:** Building purchase price.
* **RunningCosts:** Building maintenance cost. By default the value is null.
* **Hidden:** Indicates whether or not the building appears in the mine construction menu. By default the value is false.

## Stores (`.house` asset ):

Stores are the end of the production chain and demand products that are paid depending on supply and demand.
With town or city growth, stores from time to time will increase in level and  the quantity of products they demand.
If demand is low and too much cargo is delivered, prices will drop and if demand is very high but we do not cover it, prices will rise but there is a risk that the business will go bankrupt and close.
